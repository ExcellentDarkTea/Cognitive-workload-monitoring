# Cognitive workload classifier
This repository contains the implementation of a cognitive workload classification model using time series data collected from smartwatches. 
The project was developed for BMEN 619 and aims to classify cognitive workload levels (rest, load) in real-time, leveraging physiological data.

The original data can be found at the link (https://www.ubittention.org/2020/data/Cognitive-load%20challenge%20description.pdf). The dataset contains data from 23 participants, 5 for testing and 18 for training. The train and test data was generated using windows of 30 seconds.
The dataset includes the smartwatch measurements (galvanic skin response, heart rate, intervals between heart bits, and skin temperature).
